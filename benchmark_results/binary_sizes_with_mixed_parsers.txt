# Binary Size Comparison - Mixed Parser State
# Date: 2025-07-27
# Build: ReleaseSmall

## Utilities using custom argparse:
echo    26K  - Migrated successfully, all tests pass
cat     32K  - Migrated successfully, builds and runs
pwd     30K  - Migrated successfully, builds and runs

## Utilities still using zig-clap:
chmod   43K  - Still using clap
chown   44K  - Still using clap
cp     107K  - Still using clap
ln      46K  - Still using clap
ls     156K  - Still using clap (largest utility)
mkdir   41K  - Still using clap
mv     112K  - Still using clap
rm      56K  - Still using clap
rmdir   35K  - Still using clap
touch   86K  - Still using clap

## Analysis:
- Utilities with custom parser: Average ~29K
- Utilities with zig-clap: Average ~73K
- The custom parser utilities are significantly smaller
- ls is the largest utility at 156K (complex functionality)
- cp and mv are also large due to cross-filesystem support

## Note:
The benchmark-parsers executable is 2.3M because it's built
in ReleaseFast mode (optimized for speed) rather than ReleaseSmall.
